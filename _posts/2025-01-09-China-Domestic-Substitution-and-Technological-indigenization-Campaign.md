# Abstracts 

The **China Domestic Substitution and Technological Indigenization Campaign**, widely referred to as the **XinChuang initiative** (short for "Information Technology Application Innovation"), is a comprehensive strategy by the Chinese government aimed at reducing dependence on foreign technologies and achieving self-reliance in critical sectors, including semiconductors, software, and IT infrastructure. Introduced in the mid-2000s and gaining momentum in recent years, the initiative has emerged as a cornerstone of China's broader industrial policies, such as "Made in China 2025," and reflects the country's strategic focus on safeguarding national security, enhancing economic resilience, and modernizing its industrial base. This campaign is central to China's ambitions of becoming a global technological leader in the face of increasing geopolitical tensions and restrictions, particularly with the United States.[1][2][3]

The Xinchuang initiative was propelled into prominence as global trade disputes and U.S.-led export controls tightened access to advanced technologies, including semiconductor manufacturing equipment, which exposed vulnerabilities in China's tech supply chains. In response, the Chinese government intensified efforts to foster indigenous innovation, supporting domestic companies like Huawei and Alibaba to develop homegrown alternatives and prioritizing the use of Chinese-developed systems in government institutions, state-owned enterprises, and sensitive industries. Central to the initiative is the "2+8+N" rollout strategy, which sequentially introduces Xinchuang technologies across political, public, and industrial sectors, with an estimated potential market of $125 billion in areas such as banking and data centers.[4][5][6]

While the initiative has facilitated the growth of China's domestic technology ecosystem and reduced the market share of major foreign IT providers, it has also exposed challenges in the competitiveness and scalability of Chinese alternatives. Critics argue that many domestic products still lag behind their global counterparts in performance and innovation, and the heavy reliance on state-led subsidies has raised concerns about market distortions. Furthermore, the campaign has drawn international scrutiny for its implications on global trade, as China's push for forced import substitution and self-reliance disrupts existing supply chains and reshapes the international technology landscape.[7][8][9]

The Xinchuang initiative underscores China's long-term commitment to achieving technological sovereignty, with significant implications for its domestic economy and global relations. As the initiative evolves, it has been credited with driving advancements in China's semiconductor and software sectors, while also highlighting the challenges of balancing self-reliance with international collaboration. The campaign continues to play a pivotal role in shaping China's industrial modernization agenda, as reflected in the government's 2024 Work Report, which positions technological innovation as the "bedrock of national strength."[10][11][12]

# Background

The Xinchuang initiative, short for "Information Technology Application Innovation," represents China's strategic push toward domestic substitution and technological indigenization in critical sectors such as semiconductors, sensors, and software. This initiative gained traction as geopolitical tensions, particularly with the United States, escalated. The U.S. has tightened its grip on Chinese tech companies by imposing stringent export controls on advanced technologies, including semiconductor manufacturing equipment, creating challenges for China's tech sector[1][2][3]. In response, China has accelerated efforts to reduce dependency on foreign technologies and foster self-reliance by promoting domestic companies and innovations[4][5].

The Xinchuang project is rooted in China's broader strategy of ensuring national security through technology self-sufficiency. Its core objectives include developing an independent and controllable information technology infrastructure, establishing industry standards, and achieving domestic substitution in key technological domains[6]. This approach aligns with the country's "Made in China 2025" initiative, which identified semiconductors and advanced manufacturing as critical areas for national development, supported by substantial investments in research and development[7].

Historically, China's technological advancements were significantly aided by global cooperation and the free flow of talent and ideas. However, this dynamic shifted as China introduced policies prioritizing domestic capabilities, often at the expense of foreign competition[8]. For instance, the Xinchuang initiative includes a government-backed whitelist of domestic tech companies that are promoted for use in critical sectors, effectively sidelining foreign firms[4][2]. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has celebrated companies like Huawei and Alibaba for their "self-developed" platforms, which are considered critical to building a secure digital infrastructure for government and enterprise use[2].

The campaign has also been driven by practical and strategic concerns. Supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and heightened geopolitical pressures highlighted the vulnerabilities of China's reliance on imported technologies[9][5]. Furthermore, the U.S. export controls introduced in October 2022, with additional measures from allies like Japan and the Netherlands, underscored the urgency for China to localize its semiconductor industry and reduce exposure to foreign pressure[10][11].

Through the Xinchuang initiative, China has laid the foundation for a modernized industrial system aimed at enhancing productivity and building new economic momentum. The initiative's significance is reflected in the government's emphasis on it as a cornerstone of national development, with specific deadlines, such as the mandate for state-owned enterprises to replace foreign office software by 2027[3][12]. While significant progress has been made, the campaign also exposes the challenges and gaps in China's domestic tech sector, as homegrown alternatives still struggle to compete with established global players in some areas[8][5].

# The Xinchuang Initiative

The Xinchuang initiative, an abbreviation of "Information Technology Application Innovation", represents a strategic campaign by China to bolster domestic technological self-reliance and reduce dependence on foreign IT infrastructure. The concept was first introduced in 2006 as part of a long-term government plan for managing science and technology development up to 2020, marking its early origins in China's broader push for technological innovation and self-sufficiency[13][14].
In March 2016, the establishment of the "Information Technology Application Innovation Working Committee," a non-profit organization composed of 24 domestic units specializing in the development of key software and hardware technologies, formalized the Xinchuang initiative. This working committee, often referred to as the Xinchuang Working Committee, laid the foundation for coordinated efforts to advance domestic IT solutions for critical sectors[14]. By targeting sensitive areas such as government institutions, state-owned enterprises, and strategic industries, the initiative seeks to develop and deploy indigenous technologies that can replace foreign hardware and software[15][16].

The Xinchuang campaign gained momentum in 2019 with the central government unveiling policies aimed at substituting all foreign IT infrastructure within government offices and public institutions. This policy shift has driven rapid expansion in the Xinchuang ecosystem, with significant growth observed in the scale of government contracts for Xinchuang projects. For instance, between 2011 and 2018, the total value of such contracts amounted to 199 million yuan ($28.52 million), but the pace of investments accelerated significantly after 2019[13][8]. By 2022, 67 new Xinchuang-related policies had been introduced, contributing to a total of 166 policies issued by central and local governments since the inception of the initiative[13].

The campaign has also played a crucial role in reshaping China's software and semiconductor industries. Major foreign software providers have seen their market shares decline due to substitution initiatives, while domestic firms have increased their presence. These efforts align with broader national strategies such as "Made in China 2025" and the push for technological self-sufficiency, particularly in key sectors like semiconductors and advanced manufacturing[17][18]. The Chinese government has underscored the importance of innovation as the core driver of economic transformation, with technological self-sufficiency positioned as a top priority for industrial modernization[19][17].

To guide the adoption of Xinchuang products, the government has implemented a "2+8+N" sequence. This involves prioritizing deployment in political parties and government institutions first, followed by state-owned enterprises in critical sectors, and eventually expanding to other industries[15]. The potential market for Xinchuang technologies, particularly in sectors like banking and data centers that manage sensitive government data, is estimated to reach $125 billion[16]. These efforts reflect China's determination to establish a robust, independent technological ecosystem that enhances its strategic resilience.

# Implementation Strategies

China's Xinchuang initiative, also known as the IT Application Innovation campaign, is designed to promote domestic substitution and technological indigenization across various sensitive sectors, including government, finance, and data centers. A core component of this strategy is the transition from reliance on foreign technologies to domestically developed solutions by 2027, with a market potential valued at $125 billion[16][20][21].

## Promotion of Domestic Technologies

The initiative's primary goal is to establish independent and controllable information technology infrastructure and standards. This includes the development of domestic alternatives in chips, sensors, operating systems, and application software. Key examples include the Loongson processor, an indigenous CPU, which has been adopted in government systems alongside Chinese-developed operating systems and productivity tools such as WPS software[20][15]. The shift toward these technologies is further reinforced by government policies and procurement guidelines that incentivize state-owned enterprises and political institutions to adopt "Xinchuang PCs" as a replacement for the longstanding Wintel dominance[15][6].

The promotion of Xinchuang PCs follows a "2+8+N" sequence, wherein they are first adopted by political parties and government institutions, then by state-owned enterprises in strategic sectors, and finally expanded to other industries and regions. This structured rollout aims to create a sustainable ecosystem for domestic IT products[15].

## Policy Support and Investments

The Chinese government has introduced a series of support measures to bolster the Xinchuang initiative. For instance, the Ministry of Science and Technology released the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of National Technology Innovation Centers" in 2020, outlining frameworks to strengthen domestic research and development capabilities[6]. Additionally, government reports for 2024 emphasize the construction of a modernized industrial system and the acceleration of productivity advancements, with Xinchuang playing a pivotal role in achieving these objectives[12][6].

## Domestic Substitution and Market Transformation

The campaign is reshaping market dynamics by creating new demand for domestic alternatives and enabling consumption upgrades in emerging markets. Unlike merely replacing existing foreign products, domestic substitution efforts aim to tap into previously untapped markets, allowing consumers access to new categories of products[22]. This transformation has already led to a decline in the market share of foreign software providers, which collectively saw their share drop from 57.3% due to the emergence of domestic players[18].

## Targeted Sectors and Impact

The focus on transitioning state-owned enterprises and sensitive sectors away from foreign technology has significant implications for global tech companies like Intel, AMD, and Microsoft, which generate substantial revenues from China. State directives requiring the elimination of U.S.-developed microprocessors in favor of Chinese alternatives highlight the campaign's strategic intent to reduce dependence on overseas suppliers[23][21]. Should Chinese-developed PCs and processors gain traction in international markets through partnerships with manufacturers like Lenovo and Asus, this could further shift global market dynamics[20][23].

# Major Milestones

## Early Foundations (2006®C2020)

The concept of Xinchuang, which translates to "Information Technology Application Innovation" (–ŇŌĘľľ ű”¶”√īī–¬), was first introduced in a long-term government plan released in 2006. This plan aimed to guide China's science and technology development through 2020[13]. During this period, China's IT infrastructure and critical databases were largely managed by foreign companies such as IBM, Oracle, and Dell EMC, highlighting the nation's dependence on international technology[13]. This acknowledgment laid the groundwork for the strategic pivot toward fostering indigenous technological capabilities.

## "Made in China 2025" and Semiconductor Prioritization

In 2015, the "Made in China 2025" initiative marked a decisive milestone in China's shift toward domestic substitution and technological indigenization. The program identified semiconductors as a critical sector for national development, leading to substantial government investments in research and development to build a self-reliant manufacturing base[7]. This initiative accelerated efforts to reduce dependency on foreign semiconductor suppliers and foster domestic innovation in chip design and production[7].

## Government Commitment to Modernized Industry (2024)

The 2024 Government Work Report of China brought renewed focus to industrial modernization and technological innovation. For the first time, the report emphasized "vigorously promoting the construction of a modernized industrial system and accelerating the development of new quality productivity" as its foremost task[12]. The report underscored the strategic importance of science and technology, referring to them as the "bedrock of national strength" and mentioning these terms 26 times°™setting a decade-high record[12]. This reflects the government's growing commitment to integrating innovation into China's industrial and technological advancements.

## Xinchuang Ecosystem and Strategic Expansion

The promotion of Xinchuang-based PCs and IT systems followed a systematic "2+8+N" deployment strategy. This approach began with political parties and government institutions, followed by state-owned enterprises controlling critical industries, and finally extending to broader applications across various sectors[15]. The Xinchuang ecosystem has seen significant progress, with Chinese companies such as Loongson developing domestic processors, operating systems, and software solutions to replace foreign technologies in government and state-run entities[20]. These efforts have positioned Xinchuang as a core pillar in China's drive for digital sovereignty and economic growth[6].

## Challenges and Ongoing Developments

Despite its achievements, China continues to face challenges in its quest for technological self-reliance. While the Xinchuang initiative has enabled the development of homegrown processors and IT systems, the products still trail behind their international counterparts in terms of competitiveness and market adoption[8]. Moreover, the transition to domestic solutions, such as phasing out U.S. microprocessors from government PCs and servers, has significant implications for global technology dynamics[21]. Nevertheless, China remains steadfast in its efforts to improve processor design, open-source operating systems, and application software to meet domestic and international demand[20][24].

# Impact and Reception

The domestic substitution and technological indigenization campaign, spearheaded by initiatives like "Made in China 2025," has significantly influenced China's industrial and economic landscape. One of the most notable impacts has been the strategic shift of Chinese technology companies toward overseas expansion, driven by challenges in the domestic market, such as the highly competitive environment referred to as "involution."[25] Additionally, this shift is complemented by China's concerted effort to achieve technological self-sufficiency, especially in critical sectors such as semiconductors and advanced manufacturing.[17]

## Economic Impact

The campaign has led to structural changes in China's trade and industrial sectors. The push for forced import substitution industrialization has resulted in value chain upgrades and improved technology self-sufficiency.[26] Policies like "Made in China 2025" explicitly target increasing the domestic content of core components and materials to 70% by 2025, aiming to boost China's competitiveness in ten strategic high-tech industries.[27][28] As a result, the rapid growth of China's domestic chip industry has driven a surge in the number of enterprises contributing to the global semiconductor value chain.[29]

Domestically, substitution initiatives have reshaped market dynamics across various sectors. In the software industry, for instance, these efforts have caused a significant decline in the combined market share of major foreign players, which fell from 57.3% to lower levels.[18] Furthermore, domestic substitution has gone beyond replacing existing market share, often tapping into untapped demand and creating new market opportunities in emerging sectors. For example, domestic brands have enabled access to previously unavailable product categories, representing a consumption upgrade for emerging markets.[22]

## Industrial Reception

The campaign has garnered mixed reactions within the industry. On one hand, the focus on indigenization has provided a foundation for innovation and new growth, as outlined in the 2024 Government Work Report. This report emphasizes the centrality of science and technology as the "bedrock of national strength" and prioritizes the construction of a modernized industrial system as a key task.[12] The push for "Xin Chuang" (–Ňīī), or indigenous innovation, has been celebrated as a driving force for industrial productivity and social development.[12]

However, criticisms of China's domestic substitution strategy also abound. International observers have raised concerns about the reliance on non-market mechanisms, such as state financial subsidies, to achieve indigenization goals. These practices are viewed as anticompetitive and distort global market dynamics.[28] Additionally, while the campaign has made strides in reducing foreign dependence, assessments of technological self-sufficiency remain hindered by ambiguous indicators, complicating evaluations of China's true progress in this area.[30]

## Global Implications

On the global stage, the indigenization campaign has had far-reaching consequences, particularly in the semiconductor industry. The escalating trade conflict between China and the United States has intensified calls for "domestic substitution," which some experts argue could negatively impact the global semiconductor value chain.[31][11] While China's achievements in domestic substitution have positioned it as a key player in the international division of labor within this sector, the long-term ramifications of these shifts on global supply chains and technological collaboration remain a subject of debate.[11]
